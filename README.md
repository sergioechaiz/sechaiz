👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m Sergio Echaiz Gamboa.

🌟 Technology is not just a tool for me; it’s a big part of my life and something I’m deeply passionate about.

🎯 My goal is clear: to keep learning, share knowledge, tools, and experiences, and enjoy the satisfaction of achieving the projects we set out to do.

🚀 In my repositories, you’ll find projects I’m working on, collaborations I’ve started, and even some where I’m just observing. This is a space for sharing and contributing to the IT community, one small step at a time.

💡 I believe knowledge grows when it’s shared, and this is my way of giving back to the community. Whether it’s about Network Programmability & Automation, Cybersecurity, Open Source projects, or Linux, I’m always open to exploring new ideas and working together.

☕ My aim is to make life easier for IT professionals, so we can enjoy more coffee breaks and achieve more. If you have any ideas or projects, let’s connect and build something great together.

✨ Let’s create, innovate, and make a difference in our community!

🌐 My personal website is under construction, but stay tuned—it’s coming soon!
